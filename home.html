           <p class="a13"><img src="https://jssaten.ac.in/img/jss_mahavidyapeetha.gif" alt="" class="a12">The origin of JSS Mahavidyapeetha (JSSMVP), a formidable educational movement, can be traced to the establishment of a small hostel in 1928 to cater to the accommodation needs of students pursuing higher studies in Mysore. His Holiness Jagadguru Dr. Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji established the Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahavidyapeetha (JSSMVP) in 1954 and it was registered under the Societies’ Registration Act 1960.

            Focusing on a purpose as expansive and yet as specific as improving quality of life through Human Development, the JSS Mahavidyapeetha has grown from strength to strength. A long and healthy life, Education for all and a decent standard of living, the indicators of Human development, have been the underlying philosophy of Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math, Suttur Srikshethra, for centuries. This is also the philosophy for which the Mahaidyapeetha today stands for.</p>

           <p class="a13"><img src="https://jssaten.ac.in/img/OBE4.jpg" alt="" class="a12">JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida has implemented Outcome Based Education (OBE) in the Academy. JSSATEN is proud to mention that it has created necessary manpower and infrastructure to implement Outcome Based Education from the year 2014 - 15. So far the Technical Institutions have been imparting teaching through a traditional system where the learning outcomes of the students are not clearly measured. The ’Washington Accord’ emphasise on outcome based education. There is a need to develop a standard approach to match quality assurance for Engineering Programs. The graduating Engineers of the future will need to be evaluated in their outlook and experience and be ready for global opportunities. So, there is a need and challenge for all Technical Institutions to aid and empower the future students for global environment.
